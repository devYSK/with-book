**Build scalable applications using traditional, reactive, and concurrent design patterns in Kotlin**

## What is this book about?
Design patterns are well-known solutions to common architectural problems as they allow you to solve many problems efficiently and create a shared vocabulary between developers. This book shows you how easy it can be to implement traditional design patterns in the modern multi-paradigm Kotlin programming language, and takes you through the new patterns and paradigms that have emerged. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
- Implement all the classical design patterns using the Kotlin programming language.
- Apply reactive and concurrent design patterns to make your application more scalable.
- Discover best practices in Kotlin and explore its new features.
- Understand the key principles of functional programming and learn how they apply to Kotlin.
- Find out how to write idiomatic Kotlin code and learn which patterns to avoid.
- Harness the power of Kotlin to design concurrent and reliable systems with ease.
- Create an effective microservice with Kotlin and the Ktor framework.

    }
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for developers looking to apply design patterns they've learned from other languages in Kotlin to build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications.
